Among the 11 biomarkers measured in the hormonal contraceptive-HIV study, hBD-2 emerged as a top predictor of cervicovaginal infection outcome, higher both prior to three cervicovaginal infection and after onset of prevalent candida and Trichomonas vaginalis



HBD-2 is currently considered as one of the main biomarkers, capable of detecting HIV, or cervicovaginal infections @pmid:31914129



The main purpose of anti-cancer immunization is activation of the patients’ immune system against a specific antigen to provoke anti-tumor immune response. Many studies have utilized tumor-associated antigens’ subtypes like CTAs for cancer vaccination @pmid:31079006

The primary goal of cancer immunization is to activate patients' immune systems against a specific antigen to elicit an anti-tumor immune response. Although defensins are very important agents within the immune system, and it has been proven that these defenses can activate the immune system, therefore, these small peptides have become very important within the generation of these vaccines. Beta-defensin is a well-known agonist of the TLR4 / MD2 complex [@pmid:12411706; @doi:10.1038/s41598-018-26689-7]. The interaction of beta-defensin with TLR4 / MD2 of dendritic cells causes the direction of these cells towards T-helper1 cells and the subsequent provocation of cellular immune responses @pmid:21368092. Therefore, beta-defensin was incorporated into the peptide vaccine construct as an immunostimulatory adjuvant. @pmid:31079006

The present study demostrates that defensins, can damage tumor cells in vitro. Defensins-mediated lysis was confirmed in three independient assay.The presence of cytotoxic components such as dedensins in the cytoplasmic granules od the PMN echoes the presence of the other cytotoxic constituents in  natural killer (NK) lymphocytes and certain macrophages @pmid:3779104

Gaspar et all evaluated the effects of HNP-1 in solid and hematological tumor cells, and what they found was, The observed cells' height decrease caused by HNP-1 treatment they reports important changes on the cells' cytoskeleton structure after the peptide interaction with the cell membrane and its entrance into the cell.  HNP-1 has preferential activity towards solid tumors, It is expected that the differences in the composition of the membrane of both types of tumors are behind the selectivity of the peptide @pmid: 25447543

in line with these experiments Madison et all evaluated The toxicity of HNP-1 against T. cruzi is mediated by membrane pore formation and the induction of DNA fragmentation leading to trypanosome destruction @doi:10.1128/IAI.00557-07.
