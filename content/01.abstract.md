## Abstract {.page_break_before}


 In humans, endogenous Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are part of the immune system and act against pathogens. Defensins compose a class of AMPs that have activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria and viruses.their role in innate immunity as microbicidal and immunoregulatory agents that orchestrate cross-talk with the adaptive immune system, and, most recently, their association with cancer. Defensins produced by cells in the course of innate host defence serve as signals which initiate, mobilise, and amplify adaptive immune host defences. Linkage of defensins to weak tumour antigens potentiates their immunoadjuvant effects. Defensins use multiple cellular receptors, which endows them with the capacity to marshall adaptive host defences against microbial invaders recently, findings related to specific activation pathways of some of defensins have led investigators to associate them with pro-tumoral activity, contributing to a tumorigenic microenvironment. This review summarizes current knowledge of defensins to discuss their role in tumour growth, tumour monitoring and cancer treatment, is substantial interest in the identification of circulating human tumor-derived proteins in serum for the purposes of early cancer diagnosis
