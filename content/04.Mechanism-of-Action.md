##Mechanism of Action

The classical mechanism of action of cationic AMPs, such as defensins, is the disruption of the anionic bacterial membrane @pmid:24828484 . This way, bacterial destruction occurs by the interaction between the electrostatic forces of positively charged amino acids and the negatively charged cell surface [@pmid:17303777; @doi:10.1080/13102818.2019.1611385] .

Bacterial membranes are rich in negatively charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidyl-glycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL), and phosphatidylserine (PS); these are 2Ã¾ 2Ã¾ stabilized by bivalent cations such as Mg+2 and Ca+2. Gram-negative bacteria have an additional lipopolysaccharide rich outer membrane, which stands as a barrier to the cytoplasmic membrane. On the other hand, human cells are rich in neutrally charged phospholipids, such as phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin (SM). In humans, the interaction with AMPs is even less likely because of the presence of cholesterol, which affects the fluidity of phospholipids in the membrane and increases its stability [@pmid:29694838; doi:10.1080/13102818.2019.1611385]

As for the membrane-permeabilizing mechanism, different models of interaction have been proposed (a) Barrel-stave pore model, in which the HDPs form dimers or multimers that cross the membrane forming barrel-like channels @pmid: 15582982 (b) Toroidal pore model, in which the peptide forms a monolayer by connecting the outer and the inner lipid layers in the pore @:pmid 25374459 (c) Carpet model, where HDPs form a carpet-like structure covering the outer surface of the membrane acting like detergents disrupting the bacterial membrane @pmid:29694838 


In a recent work, Mathew and Nagaraj proposed the ability of HD5 to strongly bind DNA as the basis of its mechanism of action, suggesting that this interaction may inhibit essential processes associated with DNA replication, transcription or translation of important genes [@pmid:28521337; @pmid:26206286]

the defensisn has more impliction, Defensin binding to viral attachment proteins could disrupt receptor interactions critical for viral entry into the cell. HNP1-3, HD5, and hBD-3 bind a recombinant viral glycoprotein (gB) of both HSV-1 and HSV-2, which correlates with the ability of these defensins to inhibit HSV-1 and HSV-2 entry and adhesion @pmid:28715972

Viral infection can also induce defensin expression. For example, human rhinovirus induces hBD-2 in primary human epithelial cell cultures, although hBD-2 has no direct antiviral effect on the virus @pmid:24095897. Another example of how defensins can not only attack the pathogen, but can also induce the response of the immune system is Î²-Defensins exert regulatory activity in host innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, mouse Î²-defensin 2 activates Immature dendritic cells (DCs)  via  Toll-like receptor (TLR4), triggering a Th1 lymphocytes response, and human Î²-defensin 3 activates Ag-presenting cells (APCs) via TLR1 and TLR2 in an NF-ÎºB-dependent manner [@pmid:18006661; @pmid:31126693]


Now a day we continue to discover new functions of the defensins, and therefore the mechanisms of action have not yet been fully elucidated, for example studies report that the use of human defenses to regulate host metabolism and mitigate dyslipidemia, and non alcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD pmid:30860877. however, hard work is still being done to try to understand all the functions of the defensins, as well as their mechanisms of action.
