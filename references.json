Despite broad divergences in sequence and taxonomy, most antibiotic peptides share a common mechanism of action, i.e., membrane permeabilization of the pathogen. This review provides a general introduction to the subject, with emphasis on aspects such as structural types, post-translational modifications, mode of action or mechanisms of resistance. Some of these questions are treated in depth in other reviews in this issue. The review also discusses the role of antimicrobial peptides in nature, including several pathological conditions, as well as recent accounts of their application at the preclinical level.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring antimicrobial cationic polypeptides play a major role in innate and adaptive immunity. These polypeptides are found to be either linear and unstructured or structured through disulfide bonds. Among the structured antimicrobial polypeptides, defensins comprise a family of cysteine-rich cationic polypeptides that contribute significantly to host defense against the invasion of microorganisms in animals, humans, insects and plants. Their wide-spread occurrence in various tissues of these diverse organisms, and their importance in innate and adaptive immunity have led to their identification, isolation and characterization. A large volume of literature is available on defensins' occurrence, structural characterization, gene expression and regulation under normal and pathological conditions. Much has also been published regarding their antimicrobial, antiviral and chemoattractive properties, and their molecular and cellular interactions. In this review, we describe the current status of our knowledge of defensins with respect to their molecular, cellular and structural biology, their role in host defense, future research paradigms and the possibility of their utilization as a new class of non-toxic antimicrobial agents and immuno-modulators.",

    "abstract": "The antibacterial activity of human neutrophil defensin HNP-1 analogs without cysteines has been investigated. A peptide corresponding to the HNP-1 sequence without the six cysteines (HNP-1deltaC) exhibited antibacterial activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Truncated analogs wherein the nine N-terminal residues of HNP-1 and the remaining three cysteines were deleted (HNP-1deltaC18) or the G was replaced with A (HNP-1deltaC18A) also exhibited antibacterial activity. Substantial activity was observed for HNP-1deltaC and HNP-1deltaC18 in the presence of 100 mM NaCl, except in the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The linear peptides were active in the presence of carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), indicating that proton motive force was not essential for killing of bacteria by the peptides. In fact, in the presence of CCCP, the peptides were active against P. aeruginosa even in the presence of 100 mM NaCl. The antibacterial activity of HNP-1deltaC, but not that of the shorter, 18-residue peptides, was attenuated in the presence of serum. The generation of defensins without cysteines would be easier than that of disulfide-linked defensins. Hence, linear defensins could have potential as therapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "The last decade led to the discovery and characterization of several human beta-defensins. Analysis of genomic information indicates that the number of beta-defensin-like molecules encoded by the human genome may number in the tens. Growing interest in beta-defensins steadily enhances our knowledge about various aspects of their gene location, expression patterns and the transcription factors involved in their regulation in vivo. The hallmark property of beta-defensins, their antimicrobial activity, is clearly only the tip of the iceberg in the extensive network of inter-relations within the immune system in which these peptides function. Structural studies of beta-defensins provide the molecular basis for a better understanding of their properties, functions and their potential for practical applications. In this review, we present some recent advances in the studies of human beta-defensins, with an emphasis on possible correlations between their structural and functional properties.",

    "abstract": "Tissue factor (TF) is an essential cofactor for the activation of blood coagulation in vivo. We now report that quiescent human platelets express TF pre-mRNA and, in response to activation, splice this intronic-rich message into mature mRNA. Splicing of TF pre-mRNA is associated with increased TF protein expression, procoagulant activity, and accelerated formation of clots. Pre-mRNA splicing is controlled by Cdc2-like kinase (Clk)1, and interruption of Clk1 signaling prevents TF from accumulating in activated platelets. Elevated intravascular TF has been reported in a variety of prothrombotic diseases, but there is debate as to whether anucleate platelets-the key cellular effector of thrombosis-express TF. Our studies demonstrate that human platelets use Clk1-dependent splicing pathways to generate TF protein in response to cellular activation. We propose that platelet-derived TF contributes to the propagation and stabilization of a thrombus.",

    "abstract": "Human defensins, which are small cationic peptides produced by neutrophils and epithelial cells, form two genetically distinct alpha and beta subfamilies. They are involved in innate immunity through killing microbial pathogens or neutralizing bacterial toxins and in adaptive immunity by serving as chemoattractants and activators of immune cells. alpha-defensins are mainly packaged in neutrophil granules (HNP1, HNP2, HNP3) or secreted by intestinal Paneth cells (HD5, HD6), while beta-defensins are expressed in mucosa and epithelial cells. Using surface enhanced laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), alpha-defensins were found to be expressed in a variety of human tumours, either in tumour cells or at their surface. HNP1-3 peptides are also secreted and their accumulation in biological fluids was proposed as a tumour biomarker. Conversely, beta-defensin-1 (HBD-1) is down-regulated in some tumour types in which it could behave as a tumour suppressor protein. Alpha-defensins promote tumour cell growth or, at higher concentration, provoke cell death. These peptides also inhibit angiogenesis, which, in addition to immunomodulation, indicates a complex role in tumour development. This review summarizes current knowledge of defensins to discuss their role in tumour growth, tumour monitoring and cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "African animal trypanosomiasis (AAT) is endemic across Sub-Saharan African and is a major constraint to livestock production. The ability of certain cattle breeds to remain productive despite infection is known as trypanotolerance; however, the underlying immune mechanisms contributing to this trait remain poorly understood. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and acute phase proteins (APPs) are evolutionarily conserved effector molecules of the innate immune system that have important roles in the resolution of infection and activation of the adaptive immune response. Expression levels of AMP genes (TAP, LAP, BNBD4, DEFB1, DEFB5 and LEAP2) and APP genes (HP, CP, AGP, LBP, SAA3 and CRP) were investigated using real time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from two breeds of African cattle (trypanotolerant N'Dama and trypanosusceptible Boran), experimentally infected with Trypanosoma congolense. Haptoglobin and serum amyloid A (SAA) were also measured in plasma using quantitative protein assays. Results demonstrated that tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP) gene expression increased by 32-fold in Boran, compared to only 3-fold in N'Dama, by 14 days post-infection (dpi) and rising to 136-fold at 29 dpi in Boran, compared to 47-fold in N'Dama (P<0.05). Protein expression levels of SAA are elevated in N'Dama, rising to 163 microg/ml at 14 dpi compared with 72 microg/ml in Boran. The SAA expression profile mirrors the wave of parasitaemia detected in N'Dama. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in the promoter regions of the SAA3 and SAA4 genes, which are predicted to affect transcription factor binding and thereby contributing to the differential patterns of expression detected between the breeds. Whereas elevated TAP expression is a conserved component of the innate immune response to infection in both breeds, higher SAA expression levels may contribute toward trypanotolerance in N'Dama.",

    "abstract": "Human Î²-defensins (hBD) are antimicrobial peptides that curb microbial activity. Although hBD's are primarily expressed by epithelial cells, we show that human platelets express hBD-1 that has both predicted and novel antibacterial activities. We observed that activated platelets surround Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), forcing the pathogens into clusters that have a reduced growth rate compared to S. aureus alone. Given the microbicidal activity of Î²-defensins, we determined whether hBD family members were present in platelets and found mRNA and protein for hBD-1. We also established that hBD-1 protein resided in extragranular cytoplasmic compartments of platelets. Consistent with this localization pattern, agonists that elicit granular secretion by platelets did not readily induce hBD-1 release. Nevertheless, platelets released hBD-1 when they were stimulated by Î±-toxin, a S. aureus product that permeabilizes target cells. Platelet-derived hBD-1 significantly impaired the growth of clinical strains of S. aureus. hBD-1 also induced robust neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation by target polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which is a novel antimicrobial function of Î²-defensins that was not previously identified. Taken together, these data demonstrate that hBD-1 is a previously-unrecognized component of platelets that displays classic antimicrobial activity and, in addition, signals PMNs to extrude DNA lattices that capture and kill bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Diverse commensal populations are now regarded as key to physiological homeostasis and protection against disease. Although bacteria are the most abundant component of microbiomes, and the most intensively studied, the microbiome also consists of viral, fungal, archael, and protozoan communities, about which comparatively little is known. Host-defense peptides (HDPs), originally described as antimicrobial, now have renewed significance as curators of the pervasive microbial loads required to maintain homeostasis and manage microbiome diversity. Harnessing HDP biology to transition away from non-selective, antibiotic-mediated treatments for clearance of microbes is a new paradigm, particularly in veterinary medicine. One family of evolutionarily conserved HDPs, Î²-defensins which are produced in diverse combinations by epithelial and immune cell populations, are multifunctional cationic peptides which manage the cross-talk between host and microbes and maintain a healthy yet dynamic equilibrium across mucosal systems. They are therefore key gatekeepers to the oral, respiratory, reproductive and enteric tissues, preventing pathogen-associated inflammation and disease and maintaining physiological normality. Expansions in the number of genes encoding these natural antibiotics have been described in the genomes of some species, the functional significance of which has only recently being appreciated. Î²-defensin expression has been documented pre-birth and disruptions in their regulation may play a role in maladaptive neonatal immune programming, thereby contributing to subsequent disease susceptibility. Here we review recent evidence supporting a critical role for Î²-defensins as farmers of the pervasive and complex prokaryotic ecosystems that occupy all body surfaces and cavities. We also share some new perspectives on the role of Î²-defensins as sensors of homeostasis and the immune vanguard particularly at sites of immunological privilege where inflammation is attenuated.",
